# Emoji Generation
NLP project SNU fall semester 2022 
This project focuses on using NLP models to add emoji into text.
This repo contains the scripts to fine-tune 3 models for our task.

## Dataset
The dataset used is *EmojifyData-EN: English tweets, with emojis* taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rexhaif/emojifydata-en).
It contains 18 million English tweets.
We used the XXXXXXX script of this repo to preprocess the data and generate the files used for training our models.
Therefore, to use our fine-tuning scripts, you should first download the dataset and execute the preprocessing script.
